# musical-practice-stuff
A repository aimed to combine my knowledge and findings of music with a way to practice learning Python.

Its intended purpose was to be a useful program that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory.

FOR EXPERIENCED PYTHON USERS: Please note that in the first version of the program, I 100% recognize that there is a lot of unnecessary nesting that can be avoided by
defining functions and whatnot. This was easily the first/biggest script I've created using an idea I came up with on my own, and considering I've only created a handful of really small scripts, I'd say that's a valid excuse for why I still have so much nesting going on. I do plan on updating this program somewhat frequently to keep
practicing and improving with Python, and I do want to restructure main script for easier reading/cleaner code.
