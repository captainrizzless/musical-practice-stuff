# musical-practice-stuff
A repository aimed to combine my knowledge and findings of music with a way to practice learning Python.

Its intended purpose was to house useful programs that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory. Please install Python 3.11 or newer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/.
To run program, simply navigate to src/rizzless_guitar_guide, right click 'guide', and open with Python 3.11 (or newer).

Version 1.0.0 can be installed from PyPI, 1.1.0 must be downloaded from here because of packaging issues, I'm currently working on patching bugs for the next release and I'm determined to make sure everything works 100% and the code is satisfactory before releasing. There's also a very high chance that there may not even be another release anytime soon so I can focus on getting more comfortable with Python in other ways with other projects and stuff. Only time will tell.
