# musical-practice-stuff
This a test repository for the creation of my music project.

It's intended purpose was to be a useful program that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory. It was also created to help me learn Python and be able to put what I learned into practice because the class material I've been trying to 
learn through college has been nothing short of infuriating and unnecessarily complicated. I've learned far more through YouTube videos and other free content than I
have from an incredibly pricey eTextbook that doesn't present the names for terms until HALFWAY through the material. Anyway, rant over. I've super behind in that
class and I'm either gonna have to retake that class, or try to pursue programming outside of college somehow.
