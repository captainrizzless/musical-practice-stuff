# musical-practice-stuff
A repository aimed to combine my knowledge and findings of music with a way to practice learning Python.

Its intended purpose was to house useful programs that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory. If you know how to install from PyPi, you can just install rizzless_guitar_guide, but if you install here, please install Python 3.11 or newer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/ 
To run program, simply open folder, right click rizzless_guitar_guide, and open with Python 3.11 (or newer).

FOR EXPERIENCED PYTHON USERS: Please note that in the first version of the program, I 100% recognize that there is a lot of unnecessary nesting that can be avoided by
defining functions and whatnot. This was easily the first/biggest script I've created using an idea I came up with on my own, and considering I've only created a handful of really small scripts, I'd say that's a valid excuse for why I still have so much nesting going on. I do plan on updating this program somewhat frequently to keep
practicing and improving with Python, and I do want to restructure main script for easier reading/cleaner code.
