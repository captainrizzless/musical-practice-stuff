# musical-practice-stuff
A repository aimed to combine my knowledge and findings of music with a way to practice learning Python.

Its intended purpose was to house useful programs that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory. If you know how to install from PyPi, you can just install rizzless_guitar_guide, but if you install here, please install Python 3.11 or newer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/.
To run program, simply navigate to src/rizzless_guitar_guide, right click 'guide', and open with Python 3.11 (or newer).

FOR EXPERIENCED PYTHON CODE READERS: Please note that in 1.0.0, I 100% recognize that there is a lot of unnecessary nesting that can be avoided. I'm in the process of restructuring everything for easier code maintainance/reading. I'm in the process of finishing up 1.1.0, which removes all of the unnecessary nesting, I just gotta fix a couple bugs before I package and release it. Feel free to DM me @captainrizzless on Twitter if you're interested in joining the project and want to help debug or contribute ideas.
