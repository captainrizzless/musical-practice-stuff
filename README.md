# musical-practice-stuff
A repository aimed to combine my knowledge and findings of music with a way to practice learning Python.

Its intended purpose was to house useful programs that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory. Please install Python 3.11 or newer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/.
To run program, simply navigate to src/rizzless_guitar_guide, right click 'guide', and open with Python 3.11 (or newer).

Version 1.0.0 can be installed from PyPI, I'm not smart enough to figure out why I get every error imaginable when trying to import guide from rizzless_guitar_guide in 1.1.0 after installing from TestPyPI and I sure as heck do not want to install it from the real index just to get the same problems and have to increment version number again so just download here and navigate to guide and set it as a shortcut. DM me through twitter if you have any suggestions or solutions to fix that problem. Twitter handle is @captainrizzless
