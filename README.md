# musical-practice-stuff
A repository aimed to combine my knowledge and findings of music with a way to practice learning Python.

Its intended purpose was to house useful programs that I could use in my own personal downtime when practicing guitar, creating music, or just wanting to brush up
on some music theory. Please install Python 3.11 or newer here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/.
To run program, simply navigate to src/rizzless_guitar_guide, right click 'guide', and open with Python 3.11 (or newer).

Version 1.0.0 can be installed from PyPI, once I figure out why 1.1.0 doesn't work when installing from TestPyPI, I'll upload it there also. Feel free to DM me @captainrizzless on Twitter if you're interested in joining the project and want to help debug or contribute ideas.
